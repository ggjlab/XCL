# Cell landscape of larval and adult Xenopus laevis at single-cell resolution

Code used in `Cell landscape of larval and adult Xenopus laevis at single-cell resolution`.

We perform highly parallel single-cell transcriptomics with Microwell-seq to construct an initial “Xenopus Cell Landscape (XCL)”, comprising more than 500,000 cells isolated from 4 Xenopus laevis stages, from larva to juvenile, and 17 adult tissues. XCL, the first such comprehensive resource for clawed frog research, profiles more than 100 major cell types in Xenopus laevis, which provides valuable scientific evidence of cross species evolution. The XCL database website is publicly available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/XCL/ for all researchers in the Xenopus community.
